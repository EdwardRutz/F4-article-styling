		<h2>Article #1:  What is Git</h2>
		<p>Git  is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,[9] data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows</p>

		<h2>Article #2:  Why Use the Terminal or Command Prompt?</h2>
		<p>Using terminal's command-line interface and linux commands is an easy way to increase productivity.</p>

		<p>The Terminal is similiar to the Windows Command Prompt and on OS X comes as a default with bash (Bourne Again Shell).  In the shell you can run UNIX commands, mostly Linux commands.</p>

		<h2>Article #4:  Git Commands</h2>
		GIT CHEAT SHEET:  https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

		<h3>REPOSITORY</h3>
		CREATE REPOSITORY:  git init [project_name] - initializes a new repository.
		CLONE:  git clone <project_to_clone> <new_projected_name-clone>
		git remote
		git remote add <name> ~<filepath>
		git push - push your latest changes to a remote repository.
		git pull - pull the latest changes from a remote repository to your repository.

		<h3>CREATE REPOSITORY</h3>
		mkdir <dir name> or echo "# <dir name>” >> README.md
		move to dir
		git init
		touch README.md
		git add README.md
		git commit -m “message”
		git remote add origin https://github.com/edwardrz/dirname.git
		git push -u origin master



		<h3>BRANCHES</h3>
		CREATE BRANCH:  git branch <branchname>
		SWITCH BRANCHES:  git checkout branchname>
		SEE ALL GIT BRANCHES:  git branch -a
		CREATE A NEW BRANCH AND SWITCH TO IT: git checkout -b <branchname>
		DELETE BRANCH:  git branch -D <branchname>
		HEAD:  refers to the latest commit in the current branch

		git status


		git add index.html css/
		git status  (shows files in staging area to be committed)
		git commit -m "added css"
		git push origin css-stuff

		COMMIT ALL + MESSAGE:  git commit -a -m “this is my message.” 

		GIT ADD ALL
		git add -A is equivalent to git add .; git add -u.
		The important point about git add . is that it looks at the working tree and adds all those paths to the staged changes if they are either changed or are new and not ignored, it does not stage any 'rm' actions.
		git add -u looks at all the already tracked files and stages the changes to those files if they are different or if they have been removed. It does not add any new files, it only stages changes to already tracked files.
		git add -A is a handy shortcut for doing both of those.


		<h3>MERGE</h3>
		SEE WHAT BRANCH YOU ARE IN:  git branch
		SEE HISTORY OF COMMITS:  git log
		SWITCH TO MASTER:  git checkout master
		MERGE:  git merge <branchname>

		<h3>GIT STASHING</h3>
		git stash
		git status
		git stash apply to a new branch
		git stash list 


		<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
		SHOW HIDDEN FILES:  ls -a

		DELETE GIT FOLDER:  rm -r dirname/.git

		TEXT EDITOR = nano
		SHOW COMMIT HISTORY LOG:  git log 
		SEE PREVIOUS COMMIT:  git checkout HEAD~1
		TO REVIEW A COMMIT:  git checkout 5hash#s
		GET BACK TO MASTER:  git checkout master

		GITHUB
		Use the Master Branch for code that is “finished, working and ready to go into the production version of the site.” The Master Branch is used for code ready to go live.

		FEATURE BRANCHES are used for work on features, refactoring, redesigns and substantial changes.

		<h3>GIT FLOW</h3>
		[_] Try git flow to manage a projects and branches. Must install.
		https://github.com/nvie/gitflow

		git flow init
		git flow feature start feature_name
		git flow feature finish feature_name

		git flow hotfix start name
		git flow hotfix finish name
