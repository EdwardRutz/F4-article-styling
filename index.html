		<h2>Article #1:  What is Git</h2>
		<p>Git  is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,[9] data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows</p>

		<h2>Article #2:  Why Use the Terminal or Command Prompt?</h2>
		<p>Using terminal's command-line interface and linux commands is an easy way to increase productivity.</p>

		<p>The Terminal is similiar to the Windows Command Prompt and on OS X comes as a default with bash (Bourne Again Shell).  In the shell you can run UNIX commands, mostly Linux commands.</p>

		GIT CHEAT SHEET:  https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

		GIT ADD ALL
		git add -A is equivalent to git add .; git add -u.
		The important point about git add . is that it looks at the working tree and adds all those paths to the staged changes if they are either changed or are new and not ignored, it does not stage any 'rm' actions.
		git add -u looks at all the already tracked files and stages the changes to those files if they are different or if they have been removed. It does not add any new files, it only stages changes to already tracked files.
		git add -A is a handy shortcut for doing both of those.
